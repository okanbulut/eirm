Description: This package provides a suite of data analysis and visualizations tools for the analysis of dichotomous and polytomous item responses. The generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) framework is used for examining the impact of item-related and person-related variables on responses. The items are repeated measures that  are nested underpersons. The model details can be found at de Boeck and Wilson's (2004) Explanatory Item Response Models - A Generalized Linear and Nonlinear Approach <DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4757-3990-9>.
